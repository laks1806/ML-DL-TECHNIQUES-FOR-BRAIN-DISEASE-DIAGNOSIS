# ML-DL-TECHNIQUES-FOR-BRAIN-DISEASE-DIAGNOSIS
Machine learning and deep learning approaches are being successfully applied to different fields of life sciences for the past years. Medicine is one of the most suitable application domains for these techniques since they help model diagnostic information based on causal and/or statistical data and therefore reveal hidden dependencies between symptoms and illnesses. In this paper we give a detailed overview of the recent machine learning research and its applications for predicting cognitive diseases, especially the Alzheimer’s disease. The study aims to seek out risk-disease genes using machine learning approaches. Various algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees have been used along to find a suitable hypothesis for classification of candidate genes as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) associated or unassociated.
